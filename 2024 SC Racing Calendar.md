# 2024 SC Racing Calendar
## The Mission
I'm trying to get out of the house and see more motor sports. I have compiled a list of speedways in our region and a list of the most interesting events from their 2024 calendars here in a convenient to read list.

I don't intend to see every race on this list. I'm not that wealthy and don't have that kind of free time. This list is a tool I can use to make future plans.
