# Introduction

---

**Forgotten Legends RPG** is a tabletop adventure game designed for crafting and exploring a shared mythology with friends.

Several players will take on the roll of adventurers in an imaginary world while one player will control the game world and all it's other inhabitants as the **referee**.  
  
In this guide you'll learn how to create and control a character. For details on running the game as the **referee** please refer to the Referee's Handbook (coming soon).  
  
**You will need:** One 20 sided die (d20), Two six sided dice (d6), a pencil, some scrap paper, and a [printed character sheet](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1_c0TE4zsh_KOR0ZYRFxC2hPrTODms0ci/view?usp=sharing).

You start with **10 inventory slots**. All of the starting items only take up 1 inventory slot except chain mail which takes up 2. If you start out with chain mail your **armor bonus** is 2. If you just have a shield your **armor bonus** is 1. Otherwise your **armor bonus** is 0.  

## 5. Weapons

Choose a weapon to suit your needs. Some weapons require 2 hands to wield and thus can't be used with a shield. Bigger weapons take up 2 inventory slots but give you a better bonus to attacks.

|Weapon|Range|Hands|Bonus|Slots|
|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
|Bow|F|2|+1|1|
|Club|R|1|+1|1|
|Spear|C|2|+2|1|
|Sword|R|1|+2|1|
|Warhammer|R|2|+3|2|

Range is broken up into four categories.

- **Reach** (up to 5ft away)
	- Within reach without moving
- **Close** (up to 30ft away)
	- Within reach if you move
- **Near** (up to 60ft away)
	- Within reach if you sprint
- **Far** (up to 120ft away)
	- Within sight and the reach of ranged weapons

## 6. Traits

**01. Antivenemous:**  You are resistant to venom.  
  
**02. Carrion Constitution:**  You can eat raw and spoiled meat without getting sick.  
  
**03. Crinotoxic:**  When pierced, the pores in your skin release a mild poison that tastes terrible and may induce vomiting.  
  
**04. Danger Sense:**  Your party has advantage on surprise rolls.  
  
**05. Fool's Luck:**  Once per game session you may re-roll one die roll of your choice.  
  
**06. Gills:**  You have gills on either side of your neck which allow you to breathe while moving underwater.  
  
**07. Hawk Eyes:**  You can see small details even at a distance.

# How to Play

---

A **referee** controls and describes the game world to players. The players describe their characters' actions in that world. Then the **referee** describes the results of those actions.  

## Attributes

Your character has 4 attributes that apply in different circumstances.  
  
**MIGHT** represents their physical prowess and heartiness. It's good for melee attacks, feats of strength, and resisting the effects of disease or poison.  
  
**DEFTNESS** represents their speed and fine motor skills. It's good for making ranged attacks, acrobatics, and stealth.  
  
**INTELLECT** represents their powers of recall and perception. It's good for spellcasting and noticing things others miss.  
  
**CHARISMA** represents their persuasiveness. It's good for making deals and talking your way out of bad situations.  

## Action Rolls

If a player attempts an action that requires skill or luck they must make an action roll.  
  
Roll a d20, add a relevant attribute to the result, then add any bonuses you would receive from items. If the total is equal to or greater than the action’s **Difficulty Score** (**DS**) it is successful.  
  
Which attribute is relevant is up to the **referee’s** discretion.

**DS Guidelines**  
**Easy:** 10, **Moderate:** 14, **Difficult:** 18

## Dangerous Actions

If an action has a risk of danger, the difference between the roll and **Difficulty Score** is the amount of HP that character loses.  
  
Example:  
A player character attacks an enemy warrior with a **DS** of 16. They roll a d20 and add 2 from their **MIGHT** and 1 from their sword. The total is 18. The difference between 18 and 16 is 2, so the enemy takes 2 damage. A non player character’s **DS** is also their **HP**, so now the warrior's **DS** is 14. If the roll had been a 14 then the Player Character would have lost 2 **HP**.  

## Armor and Shields

Shields and armor add to your armor bonus.  

Whenever a character would lose **HP** subtract their **armor bonus** from the total damage.  

Shields add 1 to your **armor bonus** and take up 1 inventory slot. Armor can vary.  

|     Armor     | Bonus | Slots |
|:-------------:|:-----:|:-----:|
|    Leather    |   1   |   1   |
|     Chain     |   2   |   2   |
|     Plate     |   3   |   2   |
| Wooden Shield |   1   |   1   |
| Metal Shield  |   2   | 2      |

## Advantage and Disadvantage

If an action's success is uncertain but likely due to advantageous circumstances the **referee** may ask you to make a roll with advantage. Make two action rolls and keep the highest result.  
  
When attempting an action in unfavorable circumstances the **referee** may ask you to roll with disadvantage. Make two action rolls and keep the lowest result.  

## Inspiration

In order to reward creative play or good roleplaying the **referee** might give a player an inspiration point. This point can be used to reroll one action roll of their choice. Inspiration points must be used by the end of the game session or they are lost.  

## Inventory

Your **inventory score** represents how many items you can carry comfortably. For each item that exceeds your **inventory score** subtract 1 from any **MIGHT** or **DEFTNESS** Rolls.  

## Death Rolls

When a character’s **HP** reaches zero they must roll a d6. They remain alive but in critical condition for that many rounds. If they don't recieve medical attention before then they will die.

## Stabilizing

If a character has medical supplies such as those in a healer's kit they may attempt to stabilize a fallen comrade in critical condition by making an **INTELLECT** roll (DS14). If the attempt fails their patient dies even if they had rounds left from their death roll.

## Advancement

Level up after completing a quest. Raise an attribute of your choice by 1 and raise either **MAX HP** or **inventory score** by 1. Repeat this process until you reach level 6 where you will choose a vocation.  


## Healing

After eating a meal and getting at least 8 hours of sleep roll 2d6, add your **MIGHT** to the result, and regain that much **HP**.  


## Magic

Spells can be found on scrolls or as pages in spell books. Holding a spell scroll or page and reading it aloud will cast the spell without the need to make an action roll but after the spell ends it will crumble into dust.  
  
You may memorize a number of spells equal to your level. The process takes at least 8 hours per spell. Any scroll that's memorized is destroyed as if read aloud.  

Spells are listed like this:

**Spell Name** *(DS, Range)*: Description of effects

Whenever you cast a spell from memory make an **INTELLECT** roll against that spell’s **Difficulty Score** (**DS**). On a success the spell works as intended. On a failure the spell fizzles out and can’t be cast again for one day.  
  
Spells have ranges similar to weapons.
  
If you roll a 1 when casting a spell it will backfire. Roll a d6 and check the list below.    

|     |                                                                                                                                                     |
|:---:| :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
|1| All of the magical energy in your body is expended in a rush leaving you drained. Make all rolls at disadvantage until you have a full nights rest. |
|2-4| After a bang and a flash of light you go blind and deaf for a number of rounds equal to the spell's difficulty score.                               |
|5-6| Misdirected magical energy surges through your body briefly like an electric shock. You are stunned for 1 round.|  

# Combat

---
Before combat begins the **referee** will determine if anyone is surprised and then call for an initiative roll.

Combat is broken into rounds. Each round is meant to roughly 5 seconds of game time.  

During each round every player character and group of enemies can either move somewhere **close** and take one action or sprint anywhere **near** and take no actions.   

## Surprise

If a group may be surprised at the beginning of combat roll a d6. If the result is a 1-3 they are surprised.  
  
Players roll at disadvantage during the first round if they are surprised and likewise with advantage if the enemies are surprised.  

## Initiative

At the beginning of each round the **referee** and one player each roll a d6. If the player rolls the higher number they go first; if not the enemies do. The players decide the order in which their actions occur.

## Attacking

Attacking an enemy combatant requires an action roll. Roll a d20, add points from a relevant attribute, and then bonuses from relevant items. **MIGHT** is used to make melee attacks and **DEFTNESS** is used to make ranged attacks.  

Attacks at close range are considered a **dangerous action** and may result in the attacker taking damage from a counterattack.
